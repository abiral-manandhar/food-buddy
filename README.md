**Inspiration**: We saw that it was a challenge for people in our society to maintain a balanced diet. Its goal is to provide people with **balanced diet** to combat rising food prices and ill knowledge of balanced diet.

**How we built it?**: We built it using **flask** on the backend. It sends an requests to **Edamam API** in order to fetch recipes. The recipes are put into **Gemini AI** with information about a user's height, weight, specific conditions and sex in order to ensure that the diet fits the specific needs of the user.

**What it does do?**: It generates personalised diet taking into account what the user has in their pantry
