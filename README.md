Inspiration: We saw that it was a challenge for people in our society to maintain a balanced diet. So, in order to battle against nutritional deficiency diseases, we have created this.
What it does do?: It generates personalised diet taking into account what the user has in their pantry
How we built it?: We built it using flask on the backend. It sends an requests to Edamam API in order to fetch recipes. The recipes are put into Gemini AI with information about a user's height, weight, specific conditions and sex in order to generate or pick out a personalized diet.
Challenges we ran into: We found it difficult to integrate Gemini with the Edamam API
Accomplishments that we're proud of:  We were a bunch of strangers who were able to collaborate in order to create a product
What we learned: Most of the work happens towards the dying moments of a hackathon
