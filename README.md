Inspiration: We saw that it was a challenge for people in our society to maintain a balanced diet. So, in order to battle against nutritional deficiency diseases, we have created this.
What it does It generates personalised diet taking into account what the user has in their pantry
How we built it We built it using flask on the backend. It sends an requests to Edamam API in order to fetch recipes. The recipes are put into Gemini AI with information about a user's height, weight, specific conditions and sex in order to generate or pick out a personalized diet.
Challenges we ran into We found it difficult to integrate Gemini with the Edamam API
Accomplishments that we're proud of We were a bunch of strangers who were able to collaborate in order to create a product
What we learned Most of the work happens towards the dying moments of a hackathon
